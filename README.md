Medium 3 (remove_user_with_inheritance):
Changed the security popup box to have better instructions, more step by step like, telling user to go to advanced, and uncheck the inheritable permissions box.
Changed the buttons in the inheritable permissions popup box. Made "add" say "convert' and make "remove" say "remove all permissions". Also changed instructions
to recommend convert for modifying one or more users and to recommend remove for modifying all user permissions.

Hard 3 (lost-inheritance):
added additional instructions about how to user inheritance in the advanced controls. 
added info icon to "Permissions for" to recommend using inheritance if they want this file to have same inheritance as parent. This is the correct path for Hard 3.

Easy 3 (add full permission):
added info buttons for all standard permissions in the main permission box. Info box for full control says that it will add full permissions for a given user.
